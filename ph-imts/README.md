### Balance of Trade Growth Rates

It is essential to compare the actual two values (current & previous) instead of purely relying on the given *growth rate*.

The percentage changes are computed using [pandas.Series.pct_change](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.pct_change.html)

Correct interpretation as follows:

> tl;dr;

| If the Previous Value is ... | and the Current Value is ... | there was a/an ... | Example    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Smaller Positive             | Bigger Positive              | increase           | 10 -> 20   |
| Bigger Negative              | Smaller Negative             | increase           | -20 -> -10 |
| Negative                     | Positive                     | increase           | -10 -> 10  |
| Bigger Positive              | Smaller Positive             | decrease           | 20 -> 10   |
| Positive                     | Negative                     | decrease           | 10 -> -10  |
| Smaller Negative             | Bigger Negative              | decrease           | -10 -> -20 |
